        <h2>Why? Why Now?</h2>
        <h3>Information Online Takes Many Shapes</h3>

        <p>
          In the present moment, we do most of our learning through
          internet-based mediums. In the late Web 2.0 era specifically,
          information is presented in various digitally-native containers;
          tweets, TikToks, Youtube videos, etc. These internet-borne mediums
          achieved popularity by providing easy ways for individuals to both
          share their own information, and engage with information shared by
          others. Compared to conventional forms of information (static text,
          televesion, etc.), these new mediums are not 1:1 replacements, but
          more so, through their unique qualities, create the conditions for new
          kinds of information to be expressed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Tiktok trends, for example, present a repeatable format and partial
          excuse for tiktokers to either film themselves doing something or,
          more to my point, share something about themselves. Take the Roman
          Empire trend for example, which, after a point, simply became an
          excuse for users to share something they’ve been thinking about a lot
          with the internet. In the past, it would seem strange and an overshare
          to post a video like this, but given the media/information landscape
          of Tiktok, and the trend format which affirms the acceptability of the
          post, content like this, any many other strange, new kinds of
          information, are both shared and accessible to the general public.
          Other, more nondescript trends like ‘day in the life’, or ‘pov’ just
          offer users the chance to share more about their life in general. And
          with the fidelity and widespread accessibility of camera phones, never
          before have we been given such a large volume of footage from the
          lives of others.{" "}
        </p>

        <p>
          The new kind of information that this kind of content provides is
          self-affirming in its legitimacy. It informs us not through numbers or
          hard facts, but through the true-enough anecdotes that others record
          of their own lives.{" "}
        </p>

        <p>
          The same could be said for the value of Tweets, or YouTube videos, the
          common thread being that these are formats that are designed to be
          populated with information by individuals, not, say, media companies
          or corporate entities.
        </p>

        <p>
          These containers have made sharing and broadcasting information
          incredibly easy for individuals, turning the media landscape into what
          Toby Shorin calls a distributed and multidirectional network, in which
          any node can be a content creator, broadcaster, and consumer.
        </p>

        <p>
          The content created through these containers is starkly different to
          its predecessors because of this change in authorship. Beyond filming
          day-in-the-life videos, things like practicing journalism, influencing
          fashion trends, or ______ are now increasingly done by individuals.{" "}
        </p>

        <p>
          The container though, is integral to this new kind of information. To
          truly understand being conveyed, the container must be preserved as
          faithfully as possible when the information is cross-referenced. This
          is because beyond the core information itself, the containers provide
          important heuristic context that profoundly impact the absorption of
          the content.
        </p>

        <p>
          One example is the interaction between a post and the comments made
          beneath it. on sites like Instagram, YouTube and Tiktok, the presence
          of a comments section creates an entirely new dimension of
          understanding to the original media by exposing you to opinions of
          others, undoubtedly changing the way you interpret the original
          content. For humorous content , oftentimes the top comment, decided by
          the amount of likes its received, represents the funniest take on the
          original content, adding another chance layer to initial joke.
          Underneath politically controversial content, massive arguments are
          known to erupt in the comments section, providing you with a valuable
          sample of the landscape of discourse on the subject.
        </p>

        <p>
          On Twitter, viewers can’t read a tweet without being exposed to the
          number of likes, reposts and comments its garnered; a direct,
          numbers-driven format of the audience-author relationship that makes
          internet-containers unique.{" "}
        </p>

        <p>
          This kind of heuristic context is not necessarily helpful in
          understanding the main content, but ultimately is crucial in
          influencing its interpretation, and as such, deserves to be preserved
          in the case of a citation or cross-reference.
        </p>
        <h3>Conventional Citation Doesn’t Fit the Web’s Unique Geography</h3>
        <p>
          At present, when external information is referenced on the internet, a
          hyperlink is used most commonly to link the ideas together. Clicking a
          hyperlink takes the user away from what they’re reading, to the
          content’s original location. Hyperlinks do a good job of preserving
          the reference’s context, but shift the reader’s attention away from
          the core text. Furthermore, looking at the state of static writing on
          the internet, many compositions are hyperlinked to the point of
          distortion, taking their reader across dozens of tabs to communicate
          the prose’s main point.
        </p>
        <p>
          At one point, a citation was simply an abstract reference to another
          piece of writing, there was no expectation for the citation’s full
          content to be included in the text that was citing it. The internet,
          by collapsing the distance between information, allowed for sources to
          be directly connected to each other via the hyperlink. At its core
          though, the hyperlink represents an attempt at digitally mediating an
          archaic mode of citation; the fact that links take you to a separate
          tab models a ‘distance’ between ideas that no longer has to exist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Attempts have been made in the past to reconcile the rigid structure
          of writing with the decentralized nature of the web, Ted Nelson’s
          project Xanadu for example, but none have achieved widespread adoption
          so as to permanently solve this problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conventional citation breaks down in the current information
          landscape, creating an overwhelming experience across multiple tabs,
          and fails to account for the plurality of sources that information is
          absorbed from on the internet beyond static words.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of directing readers elsewhere, the experience of reading
          should instead be enriched by the distinct qualities of its
          references. Since the distance that continues to exist between ideas
          is artificially established, why not eliminate it, and present the
          citations alongside the main content? That way, the experience of
          reading the main content could seamlessly flow between citation and
          text, allowing users to gain a deeper understanding of the content
          without leaving the primary web page.
        </p>
        <h3>Reading in a Motion-Driven Media Landscape</h3>
        <p>
          This new method of reading also acknowledges the reality of
          stimulation-drivers as a necessity in holding the attention of an
          increasingly distracted body of readers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at TikTok, the most recent platform to achieve mass-adoption,
          we can surmise some trends about the future of the media landscape by
          exploring what separates it from it’s competitors. Most obviously-
          it’s presentation of frictionless, non-stop video based content has
          created a consumption cycle that maxes out our dopamine receptors, and
          weakens our drive to engage with content that doesn’t match an endless
          video stream in its level of stimulation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, the platform has provoked competition amongst individual
          TikToks for engagement, and spawned new methods of holding viewer’s
          attention that maximize the amount of movement possible in the frames
          of a video. One of the most common has been the insertion of
          ‘stimulation-booster’ content, a separate video featuring some sort of
          ambient, narrative-less motion, that keeps the user transfixed on the
          main content being presented. Other editing choices, like word-by-word
          subtitles, ＞1s shots, and sped-up/time lapse video, suggest that the
          future of content creation is one where ‘stimulation’ is king.
        </p>
        <p>
          This stimulation arms-race has consequences that extend beyond the
          Tiktok media landscape. In general, it is decimating our attention
          spans.
        </p>
        <p>
          ADHD, Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder, is a{" "}
          <span className="resource-link" id="">
            recurring topic
          </span>{" "}
          on both TikTok and its imitation platforms (YouTube Shorts, Instagram
          Reels). While it is true that ADHD diagnoses have been{" "}
          <span className="resource-link" id="26690140">
            steadily increasing
          </span>{" "}
          in the past decade, many have begun to{" "}
          <span className="resource-link" id="">
            self-diagnose,
          </span>{" "}
          pointing to symptoms like a lack of focus, restlessness and a constant
          need for stimulation as proof of their illness. Whether or not these
          diagnoses are accurate, the emergence of ADHD as a label for symptoms
          that are also exacerbated by high social-media usage, indicates that
          for one reason or another, we are having trouble focusing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The experience of reading, given that video-based content has become
          the most effective method of communication, and that younger
          generations of readers have increasingly low tolerance for static
          content, must evolve to meet the reader where they’re at. While it’s
          main goal is to use external citations to enrich the reading
          experience heuristically, src.txts also leverage the motion found in
          their citations to stimulate users, and keep their focus in an
          increasingly distracted media landscape.
        </p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          Src-txt aims to evolve reading on the internet in response the present
          state of information, citation and media outlined in the paragraphs
          above. By inserting references directly into the primary text,
          preserving the heuristic context provided by internet-borne containers
          of information, and leveraging the ambient motion found in those
          citations, src-txt creates a reading experience that makes it easier
          to engage with a text’s supporting references, and better synthesize
          their ideas to gain a more robust understanding of the primary text.
